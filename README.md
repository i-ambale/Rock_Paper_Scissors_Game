Rock, paper, scissors (also known as Rochambeau, Roshambo, or Janken) is a fun and easy hand game that anyone can learn and enjoy. It’s a great way to make minor decisions when you and a friend can’t agree on something, or even just an entertaining way to pass the time. The neat thing about the game is that almost anybody can pick the rules up in a matter of seconds. In this article, we’ll break the game down so that you and a friend can play whenever you’d like.

Things You Should Know
Rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, and paper beats rock.
Agree ahead of time whether you’ll count off “rock, paper, scissors, shoot” or just “rock, paper, scissors.”
Use rock, paper, scissors to settle minor decisions or simply play to pass the time.

1
Rock beats scissors and loses to paper. Make a closed fist to throw a rock out. This powerful play is strong enough to break the fragile scissors, but can’t fight its way past the paper, which wraps itself around the rock to suffocate it.[1]
Don’t tuck your thumb when you throw rock. You may telegraph your move, and a loose fist with the thumb inside can be mistaken for paper.

2
Paper beats rock, but loses to scissors. Lay your fingers flat and keep them together to play paper. The slick and flexible paper wraps around the rock to lock it down, but it can’t fight back against the sharp scissors.[2]
Keep your fingers touching when you play paper. If you spread them out, people might accuse you of playing scissors.
You can remember all of this with the phrase, rock breaks scissors, scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock.

3
Scissors beat paper but loses to rock. Play scissors by making a peace sign with your index and middle finger. The sharp scissors carve through paper with ease, but they’re too weak to stand up to a rock slamming into them.[3]
Keep your scissors vertical. Laying your fingers flat looks too much like paper.
